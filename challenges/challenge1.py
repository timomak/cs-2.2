# Graph() #creates a new, empty graph.
# addVertex(vert) #adds an instance of Vertex to the graph.
# addEdge(fromVert, toVert) #Adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
# addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight) #Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
# getVertex(vertKey) #finds the vertex in the graph named vertKey.
# getVertices() #returns the list of all vertices in the graph.
# getNeighbors(x) # lists all vertices y such that there is an edge from the vertex x to the vertex y;
